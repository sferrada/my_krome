# This is the [KROME](https://bitbucket.org/tgrassi/krome/overview) repository

KROME is a nice and friendly package to model chemistry and microphysics 
 for a wide range of astrophysical simulations. 
 Given a chemical network (in CSV-like format) it automatically 
 generates all the routines needed to solve the kinetic of the system, 
 modelled as system of coupled Ordinary Differential Equations. 
 It provides different options which make it unique and very flexible. 
 Any suggestions and comments are welcomed. KROME is an open-source 
 package, GNU-licensed, and any improvements provided by 
 the users is well accepted. See disclaimer below and GNU License 
 in gpl-3.0.txt.
