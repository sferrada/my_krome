! This test is aimed to reproduce the evolution
! of the primordial gas based on the Galli&Palla 1998 paper
! within the framework of Friedmann cosmological models 
! from redshift z=10^4 to z=0.
! It includes the evaluation of H+ recombination based on 
! Sasaki & Takahara (1993) paper.
! For additional details see Galli&Palla A&A, 335, 403, 1998.
