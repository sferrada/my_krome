!******************************************************************************
!This is a simple one-zone collapse test following
! the chemical and thermal evolution of a primordial cloud 
! irradiated by Far-UV photons.
!The dynamics is described by the Larson-Penston-type
! similar solution and includes cooling, heating processes
! and photochemistry. 
!The test employes different values of the UV flux in terms of
! J21 (erg/cm2/s/Hz/sr) ranging from 0 to 1d5.
!A T5 (1e5 K) black-body spectrum is assumed for the photodissociation of H2.
