!***************************************************************
!This test is based on the Zel'dovich nitric oxide mechanism
! involving two reactions and its reverse as discussed 
! in Al-Khateeb et al. 2009. The aim of the test is to 
! evaluate the inverse reaction rate coefficients applying 
! the thermodynamic method discussed in Grassi et al. 2013
! and employed in KROME.
! Initial conditions are n = 1e-3 mols, Volume = 1e3 cm3 and
! T = 4000 Kelvin.
