! This test uses the data from the LAMDA database
! to compute the cooling from the O2 molecule.
! It consists in a set of runs with different
! densities and temperatures. The chemistry is
! solved to the equilibrium, then the cooling
! is computed. The cooling function is not
! a table, but is computed on the fly using
! the atomic data provided by LAMDA.
