!This is a simple one-zone collapse test following
! the chemical and thermal evolution of a primordial cloud irradiated
! by both a UV flux below the Lyman limit (13.6 eV) and a X-ray flux
! between 2-10 keV. 
!For further details we remind to Inayoshi, MNRAS, 416, 2748-2759, 2011.
!Note that the results are different compared to Inayoshi+, 2011 as
! the cross-sections employed here for H and He photoionization are
! from Verner+ 1996, while Inayoshi+ adopted older outdated cross-sections.
!The dynamics is described by the Larson-Penston-type similar solution.
!The test produce results for four different values of the UV flux
! expressed in terms of J21 (erg/cm2/s/Hz/sr) ranging from 0 to 3000.
!The X-rays flux also expressed in terms of J21_xr is fixed to 0.1.
!The following cooling/heating processes are included in the test:
! H2 cooling from Glover&Abel 2008, atomic cooling from Cen 1992, 
! compton cooling, chemical heating, and heating coming from x-rays.
!The test reprpoduces the results reported in Latif+, 2014
