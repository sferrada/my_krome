! This test solve the standard Lotka-Volterra equations.
! It is mainly aimed at showing how in KROME you can add
! arbitrary ordinary differential equations to your
! ODE system.
! The Lotka-Volterra equations, are first-order, non-linear, differential equations 
! used to describe the dynamics of biological systems in which two species interact, 
! one as a predator and the other as prey.
