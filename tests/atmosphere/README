!This test couple the standard diffusion equation for a gas
! with the solution of the ODE system for chemical species
! based on the network of Kasting & Donahue 1980.
!The initial conditions are taken from Segura et al. 2003.
!In order to keep the chemical time-scale similar to the 
! dynamical time a normalization of the chemical species
! abundances is applied. For further details refer to the KROME paper.
