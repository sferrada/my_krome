This file (22Aug2014) is the changelog that contains the main modifications
 from the krome_stable version to the krome_dev version.
  - mylin (instead lapack for metal cooling levels < 3)
  - metals from file
  - metals excitation/de-excitation now tabulated
  - print flux utility
  - network file flexibility (e.g. NONE for reaction rates T limits)
  - tokens for reaction networks file preparation (see Wiki)
  - ierr for solver
  - automatic check on network to add reverse if needed
  - adiabatic index evaluation improvement (ROT, VIB, FULL, standard)
  - mean molecular weight
  - option check thermochemistry
  - md5 to check tests
  - new RAMSES, ENZO patches
  - check consistency
  - shielding=WG11, DB96, H2 self-shielding from Wolcott&Greene 2011 and Draine & Bertoldi 1996
  - collisional dissociation by Martin 1996
  - networks update (mostly primordial, now almost state-of-art)
  - cooling expansion for early Universe evolution (added early Universe test based on Galli & Palla 1998)
  - CO network
  - error dump improved (KROME_ERROR_REPORT)
  - Cosmic rays heating
  - photo-heating with Av-approximation (check react_COthin) 
  - isotopes fix
  - additional functions (e.g. to evaluate metallicity)
  - cooling quenching
  - H2 cooling improved (extended limits)
  - utility to write and plot cooling e heating functions
  - new photochemistry module based on bins
  - X-rays physics (secondary ionisation and heating)
  - automatic database for some reactions-types (e.g. atomic photoionisations)
  - H2 Omukai opacity
  - num2col e col2num functions to evaluate column density (based on jeans or on 2/3 expression)
  - options filename, new option to use an external file with the KROME options listed
  - nuclearMult, option for nuclear multiplicity factor
  - usePlainIsotopes, allow the use of isotopes like 6Li
  - improved clean utility
  - documentation now based on the bitbucket Wiki
  - chianti database interface to KROME
  - Thread-safety improvement, solver + openMP
  - new tests available
  - Makefile slightly improved
  - Full gfortran compatibility
  - updated solar abundances (Asplund 2009)
  - wizard.py script to run KROME with ease
  - improved krome_user module with a series of useful functions
  - krome_subs split in different modules
